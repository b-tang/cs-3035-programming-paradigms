# CS 3035: Programming Paradigms
This repository contains projects and assignments for the CS 3035 Programming Paradigms course, which covers key programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, object-oriented, and logic-based programming. Through this course, you'll explore how different paradigms address programming challenges and how they apply in real-world scenarios.

## Contents
- Assignments: Detailed implementations of various programming exercises across paradigms.
- Projects: Larger projects demonstrating the integration of multiple paradigms.
- Examples: Practical examples illustrating core concepts of each paradigm.

## Technologies
- Languages: Includes languages commonly associated with each paradigm, such as Java, Python, Haskell, etc.
- Frameworks: Any frameworks or libraries specific to assignments or projects.

## Getting Started
